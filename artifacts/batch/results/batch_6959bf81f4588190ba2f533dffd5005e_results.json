Consider adjusting it to Medium if there is significant demand from users or if it aligns with upcoming strategic initiatives.\n\n3. **Potential Blockers or Dependencies**:\n   - **Technical Dependencies**: May need integration with existing systems (e.g., user authentication, payment gateways), which could complicate implementation.\n   - **Resource Availability**: Availability of developers and designers with experience in marketplace platforms.\n   - **Regulatory Considerations**: Ensuring compliance with any legal or financial regulations for online marketplaces.\n   - **User Acceptance**: Requires input from users to ensure it meets community needs, which can impact the timeline if adjustments are needed based on feedback.\n\n4. **Recommended First Step**: \n   - Conduct a requirement-gathering session with stakeholders (including potential users) to outline the key features and functionalities desired in the Community Forge marketplace.
